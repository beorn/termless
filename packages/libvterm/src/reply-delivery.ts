// Audited synchronous feed -> output sink -> onResponse path: init() attaches a growable sink through libvterm's
// vterm_output_set_callback (build/flat-api.c termless_vterm_output_attach), so no reply is dropped at the engine's
// 4096-byte outbuffer; feed() writes the input, then drains the whole sink in order into onResponse, and throws when
// the sink lost a reply to a failed allocation (src/backend.ts feed). Whole DA1, DA2 and DECRQSS replies behind a
// 5600-byte backlog were measured on this artifact (tests/window-ops-probes.test.ts). The WASM is the receipt's pair,
// built from build/flat-api.c and build/build.sh at libvterm v0.3.3.
// Re-audited for per-instance OSC 52 clipboard callbacks and the upstream unsigned-byte selection fix;
// feed/response delivery is unchanged, including replies behind the 5600-byte backlog.
// Re-audited for native reverse-property observation; callback acceptance and the reply sink are unchanged.
// Re-audited for the native application-cursor getter; it reads state without writing input or output.
// Re-audited with one property/history observer, native keypad read and recorded reflow enablement.
// Reply/selection sinks and feed draining retain the existing path; exact artifact tests verify this pair.
// Re-audited for native keyboard/mouse input capture: synchronous callback swaps restore the original reply sink
// in finally without changing selection callbacks; tests retain a queued reply prefix and OSC52 state after failures.
// Re-audited for native paste input capture: start/unichar/end uses this same callback swap, preserves queued replies
// and OSC52 ownership on errors, and keeps primary plus cleanup failures. Native handles stay private.
// Re-audited for the native-key extension declaration; keyboard capture and reply delivery are unchanged.
// Re-audited for OSC 9 state fallbacks: only completed command-9 payloads enter the observer's list; other commands
// are declined. The callback writes no replies, leaves OSC52 selection ownership intact, and preserves feed draining.
// This declaration excludes itself; determining adapter edits require re-audit.
