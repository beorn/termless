// Audited synchronous feed -> native response barrier -> readResponse -> onResponse path:
// the engine writes replies into an unbounded SharedWriter buffer (native/src/lib.rs:33-41); feed() sends a paste barrier
// through that writer and waits until the flush that ends with it, failing loudly after 500 ms (lib.rs:188-228, 230-238);
// the TypeScript feed then drains the whole buffer into onResponse (src/backend.ts feed). Re-audited when the pixel
// geometry reached the native constructor and resize, and again when its check moved to src/terminal/types.ts
// declaredPixelGeometry, neither of which touches that path; bound to the native artifact built
// from these sources (Cargo.lock sha256 8eaeab73), whose build receipt names the source commit.
// Re-audited for nullable blink/native blink forwarding: only cell readback changed; the reply path above is unchanged.
// Re-audited for owned OSC 8 URI readback: the existing synchronous reply path is unchanged.
// Re-audited for existing underlineColor forwarding: cell extraction changes no response/callback route.
// Re-audited for productViewport absence metadata only; feed/response delivery is unchanged.
// Re-audited for absolute retained-row readback and enumeration: feed/response delivery is unchanged.
// This declaration excludes itself; determining adapter edits require re-audit.
